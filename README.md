# The White Room
A video game for Linux where you're trapped in a white room with only a door leading to your next clue. It was initially created for CPE 476, 3D Real-Time Graphics, in January-March 2013 at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and then it became <a href="https://github.com/goofanader">goofanader</a>'s senior project April-June 2013.

This source code originally was on Google Code, but it has since been migrated from there.
